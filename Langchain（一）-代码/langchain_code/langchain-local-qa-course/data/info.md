## basic
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:


- Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
- Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)


## framework
This framework consists of several parts.
- LangChain Libraries: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic run time for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents.
- LangChain Templates: A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks.
- LangServe: A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API.
- LangSmith: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.


## summary
Together, these products simplify the entire application lifecycle:

- Develop: Write your applications in LangChain/LangChain.js. Hit the ground running using Templates for reference.
- Productionize: Use LangSmith to inspect, test and monitor your chains, so that you can constantly improve and deploy with confidence.
- Deploy: Turn any chain into an API with LangServe.
